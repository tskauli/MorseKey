This is a compact 3D-printed manual Morse key. The design offers
precise movement with adjustable force and travel, in a very simple
3D-printed design. Compact and lightweight, the key is suitable for
portable use. There is a choice of different knob shape options
(according to parameter "knobtype" in the code). The default type
is the most mature design. The key design is parametric so that
dimensions can be varied to suit different tastes. It is also easy
to adjust the code to accommodate printer tolerances, or different
screw dimensions.

The design is coded in OpenScad. All dimensions are controlled by
parameters that can be easily changed in the code.
